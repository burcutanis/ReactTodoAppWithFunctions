# Todo App With React Functions

It is a simple app which I wrote during the learning process of react.js.
It was writting by using react functions.

Functionalites: 
* Add new todo to the todo list
* Check a todo in the todo list
* Delete a todo from todo list
* Toogle a todo in the todo list
* Filter todos as all, completed or active
